# Zcash Foundation Grants: Call for Proposals (Q2 2018)

The Zcash Foundation is offering grants to fund projects proposed and carried out by Zcash community members, similar to the [2017Q4 Grant Program](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2017Q4).

**Please note: we are in the initial stages of planning Q2's grant program--the program has not yet received board approval--and all details haven't been established yet (review committee, important dates, money to disburse, etc.). But the proposal process will be very similar to before, so feel free to contirbute issues/proposals early, and we'll be sure to broadcast when final dates have been selected.**

## Scope

We are interested in funding proposals that support both the [Mission](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/MISSION.md) and [Values](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/VALUES.md) of the [Zcash Foundation](https://z.cash.foundation). The scope of activities is broad, and can include: software development (e.g., wallet software, libraries, etc.), infrastructure development and maintenance (e.g., hosting forums and block explorer services, etc.), education and outreach, science and research, and many more. It is expected that projects will maintain an open process and—if applicable—will release code as open source.

The [Zcash Foundation](https://z.cash.foundation) is a non-profit organization, and is therefore especially interested in funding proposals that are public goods and not obviously monetizable. We are not looking to fund startup companies that can seek crowdfunding or venture capital investing, or websites that sell advertising space.

The intended scale is 1 to 6 person-months of effort, plus direct expenses such as servers and cloud services.

## Context

This is the fourth round of monetary awards granted to the community. The [Open Source Miner Challenge](https://zcashminers.org/) was focused specifically on optimized open-source mining software. The [Test Transaction Awards](http://z.cash.foundation//blog/test-transactions/) were awarded retroactively to several community pioneers for their outstanding technical and community-building work. The [2017Q4 Grants](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2017Q4) were awarded through a similar process outlined here.

The new Zcash Foundation Grants aim for a systematic, forward-looking mechanism to support community efforts, with broader scope and an open community-review process.

## The Proposal Process

1. The proposer files a pre-proposal *Issue* in this dedicated Github repository: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues The *Issue* should explain the tentative proposal–informally but in detail. This must be done by **[TODO: DATE TBD]** 
1. Public discussion will ensue in comments on the pre-proposal *Issue*. The discussion will hopefully include support, critique, suggestions for improvements, and pointers to relevant resources.
1. The Zcash Foundation Grant Review committee—as a result of this debate, and its discretion—will advise pre-proposals if they are strong candidates and will invite them to submit a full, stand-alone proposal. For others they will advise grants are unlikely to be awarded—but this advice will be provisional and will not restrict any pre-proposal for final submission.
1. Subsequently, and no later than **[TODO: DATE TBD]**: the proposer will post a formal stand-alone Submission document, as an attachment in the issue. The Submission should summarize the official proposal, following the structure outlined below. The proposer may revise the Submission, e.g., to address ongoing feedback, by filing new versions of pre-proposals as attachments in the *Issue*, until the Submission Deadline of **[TODO: DATE TBD].**
1. After the Submission Deadline, the Zcash Foundation Grant Review Committee will convene to make its funding decision, based on the submissions, the community feedback gathered in the issues, and possibly other consultation.

## Structure of the Submission

The formal submission document should be be structured as follows:

**Motivation and overview**

Why are you doing this? What impact will the project have if it is completely successful?

**Technical approach**

How will it work? Convince us that your project has a good chance of meeting the goals of the motivation. What are the risks, unknowns and external dependencies, and how will you cope with them?

**Team background and qualifications**

Summarize pertinent background of the team member(s). Optionally, attach CVs.

**Evaluation plan**

What would your project look like if successful, and how would we be able to tell? Include quantifiable metrics if possible.

**Security considerations**

What are the implications of this project to the privacy, integrity, availability and decentralization of Zcash? Does it create, or mitigate, potential attacks? Is user education needed to use it securely? This is especially relevant for technical projects.

**Schedule**

What is your timeline for the project? Please list several concrete milestones along this timeline.

**Budget and justification**

How much money do you need, and how will you spend it (e.g., compensation for your effort, specific equipment, specific external services)?

We expect a typical project to require approximately 3 pages to adequately discuss the above.

**Email address(es) for direct contact**

GitHub issues are great for public discussion but the review committee occasionally prefers email addresses for direct communication.

## Progress Report

Funded projects will be required to submit a short report 6 months after receiving funding—for the sake of transparency, ease of locating products, and evaluating future proposals from the same proposers.

## Payment

Funds will be disbursed to approved projects in ZEC currency, in a lump sum.

## Available Funding

**[TODO: FUNDING AMOUNTS]**

**[TODO: Distinguish between amounts per grant and total grant program allotment, clarify that funds are "discretionary" for academics]**

Note that—depending on your country of residence—taxes may be due on your grant award when they are received and/or when your ZEC is sold.

## Grant Review Committee

Funding decisions will be made by a *Zcash Foundation Grant Review Committee*, appointed by the Zcash Foundation Board. The funding recommendation of the committee will be published, and will subsequently need to be approved by the Zcash Foundation Board. (The expectation is that the Board will approve the funding recommendation of the committee; if not, the Foundation will make the exception publicly visible).

The Grant Review Committee consists of:

**[TODO: GRANT COMMITTEE MEMBERS]**

### Conflict of Interest Policy

If you have a potential conflict of interest with members of the review committee or Foundation, you are required to note the nature of the conflict in your pre-proposal.

Review committee members are allowed to submit proposals, but if a member of the review committee submits a proposal, then they must recuse themselves from committee discussion of that proposal.


## Important Dates

Though we don't have concrete timelines yet, it's very likely that the due date for initial proposals will be in the beginning of calendar year Q2 and the final proposals will be due by the middle of Q2. More information soon!

**[TODO: FILL IN IMPORTANT DATES]**

## Moderation and Code of Conduct

Submitted proposals and discussions should be productive and respectful. For guidance on this, see the [Zcash Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) Inappropriate posts or comments will be closed (but archived for post hoc review) by Foundation directors or staff.

Pseudonymous submissions are allowed and encouraged—however, please note that due to the Foundation's reporting requirements as a 501(c)3 that your identity will need to be revealed to Foundation personnel and we'll need to collect and report tax information to the IRS.
